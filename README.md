## Testing

### Test Coverage
I prefer to keep logic out of the components and instead use the store to manage the state and logic.
For demo purposes I tested only critical on my opinion parts of the app.
However, in a real-world scenario, I would write more tests to cover a bit more and ensure the app is working as expected.
